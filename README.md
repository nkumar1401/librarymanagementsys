 Library Management System API â€“ Django 

This is a backend system I built for managing a library, using Django and Django REST Framework. It includes basic features like book management, borrow request handling, JWT-based login system, and librarian/student roles.

 Key Features

- JWT Authentication (login, refresh)
- Role-based access: Librarian vs Student
- Book creation, update, delete (for librarians)
- Borrowing system with request/approve/return flows
- Auto-updates available copies using Django signals
- Book reviews with user association
